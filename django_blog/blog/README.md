### Authentication System Overview

An authentication system is a mechanism used to verify the identity of a user or entity. It ensures that only authorized users can access certain resources or perform specific actions. Common authentication methods include username and password, multi-factor authentication (MFA), and OAuth.

### Setup Instructions

#### 1. Choose a Framework
Select a web framework that supports authentication. For this example, we'll use Django, a popular Python web framework.

#### 2. Install Django
First, ensure you have Python installed. Then, install Django using pip:
```bash
pip install django
```

#### 3. Create a Django Project
Create a new Django project:
```bash
django-admin startproject myproject
cd myproject
```

#### 4. Create a Django App
Create a new app within your project:
```bash
python manage.py startapp myapp
```

#### 5. Configure the Project
Add the new app to your project's settings. Open `myproject/settings.py` and add `'myapp'` to the `INSTALLED_APPS` list:
```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...
    'myapp',
]
```

#### 6. Set Up User Authentication
Django comes with a built-in authentication system. To use it, include the authentication URLs in your project's URL configuration. Open `myproject/urls.py` and add:
```python
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path, include

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('accounts/', include('django.contrib.auth.urls')),
]
```

#### 7. Create User Registration View
Create a view for user registration in `myapp/views.py`:
```python
from django.contrib.auth.forms import UserCreationForm
from django.urls import reverse_lazy
from django.views import generic

class SignUpView(generic.CreateView):
    form_class = UserCreationForm
    success_url = reverse_lazy('login')
    template_name = 'registration/signup.html'
```

#### 8. Add URL for Registration
Add a URL pattern for the registration view in `myapp/urls.py`:
```python
from django.urls import path
from .views import SignUpView

urlpatterns = [
    path('signup/', SignUpView.as_view(), name='signup'),
]
```

#### 9. Create Templates
Create the necessary templates for login, logout, and registration. In `myapp/templates/registration/signup.html`:
```html
{% extends "base_generic.html" %}

{% block content %}
  <h2>Sign Up</h2>
  <form method="post">
    {% csrf_token %}
    {{ form.as_p }}
    <button type="submit">Sign Up</button>
  </form>
{% endblock %}
```

### User Guide

#### Register a New User
1. Navigate to `/accounts/signup/`.
2. Fill out the registration form with a username and password.
3. Submit the form to create a new account.

#### Log In
1. Navigate to `/accounts/login/`.
2. Enter your username and password.
3. Submit the form to log in.

#### Log Out
1. Navigate to `/accounts/logout/`.
2. Confirm to log out.

This setup provides a basic authentication system using Django's built-in features. You can further customize it by adding email verification, password reset functionality, and more.
